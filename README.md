# HR Analytics & Employee Attrition Insights
## *Power BI dashboard project focused on workforce stability, retention, and HR decision-making*

# Overview

This project demonstrates how HR data can be transformed into actionable insights to understand employee attrition and support data-driven retention strategies.

Working with a publicly available HR dataset, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyse attrition patterns across job roles, tenure, demographics, and compensation bands, helping HR teams identify high-risk segments.

Using:

- HR data cleaning and feature engineering

- Attrition, tenure, and demographic analysis

- Segmented workforce analysis through Power BI dashboards

- KPI-driven HR reporting for decision-makers

The goal was to help HR and leadership teams move from static reporting to insight-led workforce planning, enabling targeted interventions to reduce attrition and improve employee stability.

# Business Problem

Employee attrition directly impacts productivity, hiring costs, and organisational stability, yet HR teams often lack clarity on why employees leave.

Key challenges addressed:

- Limited visibility into attrition drivers across roles and demographics

- Difficulty identifying high-risk employee segments early

- Reactive retention strategies instead of targeted interventions

- Over-reliance on aggregate metrics without segmentation

Key questions addressed:

- Which roles and employee groups experience the highest attrition?

- At what stage of tenure are employees most likely to leave?

- How do age, salary, education, and gender influence attrition?

- Where should HR focus retention and engagement efforts?

# Solution Approach

I designed an HR analytics dashboard in Power BI to translate raw employee data into decision-ready insights.

🔹 Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

- Cleaned and validated HR data for consistency and accuracy

- Removed duplicates and handled missing values

- Engineered features such as:

  - Attrition status

  - Age groups

  - Salary bands

  - Years at company (tenure)

- Workforce counts and attrition rates

🔹 Core HR Metrics & KPI Tracking

- Calculated overall attrition rate, headcount, and exits

- Analysed average age, salary, and tenure across the workforce

- Designed high-level KPI cards for leadership overview

🔹 Segmented Attrition Analysis

- Attrition by job role

- Attrition by years at company (tenure analysis)

- Attrition by age group, education field, salary band, and gender

- Identification of high-risk employee segments

🔹 Dashboard Design for HR Decision-Making

- Built interactive visuals to enable drill-downs

- Designed the dashboard for HR managers, not analysts

- Focused on clarity, segmentation, and actionability

# Key Business Insights and Strategic Impact
*(Translated for HR, people analytics, and leadership teams)*

- Overall attrition stands at 16.1%, indicating a material workforce risk
 → Retention must be a strategic priority, not an HR afterthought

- Attrition is highest in the first year of employment
 → Onboarding and early engagement are critical levers

- Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives show the highest attrition
 → Role-specific retention strategies are required

- Employees aged 26–35 are most likely to leave
 → Mid-career development and growth opportunities matter

- Lower salary bands experience disproportionately high attrition
 → Compensation and value proposition gaps impact retention

# Strategic Recommendations

- Design role-specific retention programs for high-attrition job roles

- Strengthen onboarding and early-tenure support frameworks

- Conduct targeted compensation and growth reviews for vulnerable segments

- Introduce tenure-based engagement interventions (first year, mid-career)

- Use HR dashboards as a continuous monitoring tool, not a one-time report

# Tools and Technologies

- Power BI – data modelling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards

- HR Dataset – publicly available Kaggle dataset (HR_Analytics.csv)

# Why this Matters for HR & Leadership Teams

This project shows how HR analytics can:

- Identify attrition risks early

- Enable targeted, data-driven retention strategies

- Improve workforce stability and planning

- Support leadership decisions with clear evidence

Applicable to:

- Corporate HR teams

- People analytics functions

- Workforce planning and retention initiatives

- Mid- to large-scale organisations

# 📌 Note

This project uses a publicly available HR dataset.

The focus of the repository is on insight generation, segmentation logic, and HR decision support, rather than raw data processing.
